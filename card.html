			<p class="interesting-paragraph">A new cat has ascended the throne of feline Internet stardom, and his name is
				 Snoopybabe — or Snoopy for short. He’s attracted fans with his giant golden
				 eyes and elegant ringed tail. Miss Ning said his distinctive look comes from
				 his parents, one an American short-hair and the other a Persian cat. His
				 droopy eyes make him appear innocent all the times.</p>
